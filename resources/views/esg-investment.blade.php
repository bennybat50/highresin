                        <p>Both the ethical and practical values of ESG have always been at the heart of what Janus Henderson stands for. The biggest change we have seen, and welcome, is the increased appetite of clients, and the industry in general, to talk about ESG. The drive to assess more than just financial returns reflects a broad, cultural change within the industry, and perhaps a generational shift within society. We welcome this change and support the increased demand for corporate commitment to ESG standards.</p>

                        <p>ESG factors are integral to how we think about risk. In the broadest sense, this ranges from an opening up of traditional governance issues, right through to the biggest existential questions. Among our clients, attitudes towards ESG and sustainability vary as much as risk profiles. We are respectful of this diversity of values and offer strategies and products accordingly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As a result, we generally do not impose blanket exclusions across our portfolios. Instead, we strive to manage an investment platform with the tools and flexibility to apply exclusions to meet the spectrum of requirements of our clients. We believe our ability to have the greatest impact as active managers is through active engagement with the firms in which we invest.</p>
