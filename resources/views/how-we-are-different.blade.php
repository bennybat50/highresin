                    For over 6 years, Highresin has worked in our clients’ best interests by thinking and acting

                    That’s why Highresin currently manages $15 million for investors worldwide and helps over 9,000

                        As a fiduciary, we always put your interests first—and we’ve designed our entire business to
                        keep it
                        this way. Unlike some money managers, we have no incentives to sell you commission-based
                        financial
                        products or place trades in your account when it’s not best for you. Our simple fee structure
                        aligns
                        your interests with our business goals. Simply put, when you do better we do better.

                        We’re more than just stock pickers. We believe active portfolio management centred on your
                        long-term
                        goals is the best way to discover opportunities and achieve long-term results. Our five-person
                        Investment Policy Committee, supported by large in-house research staff, analyzes global
                        investing
                        opportunities—narrowing down from country and sector to find securities they think will do well
                        moving forward. This disciplined approach allows us to interpret information differently and
                        find
                        global investment opportunities other money managers may overlook.

                investment strategy and even considers important factors outside of your portfolio. If you own an
                annuity, Highresin can analyze it and help you determine if it makes sense as a long-term investment for
                you. The result is a highly personalized approach consistent with your goals and needs.
