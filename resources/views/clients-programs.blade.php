                Highresin continuously seeks new ways to enrich our client experience. In addition to helping you
                achieve your long-term financial goals via portfolio management, we created a series of programs aimed
                at providing you with timely updates and education regarding the financial markets and your portfolio.

                These events, held in more than 5 cities nationwide, are designed exclusively for clients of Highresin
                and offer unprecedented access to senior decision-makers and other clients of the firm. They include
                Highresin Forecast Seminars, Investment Roundtables, Highresin Friends events, and more. There is no
                additional cost to our clients for these events, and we encourage you to attend as many as you would
                like each year.

                This high level of client support and proactive customer service is a cornerstone of our Private Client
                Group. It’s a level of service institutional investors take for granted and is usually not available to
                individuals. We believe in providing the highest level of customer service to all of our clients—whether
                they’re individual investors or institutions.

You’ll learn exactly how we plan to manage your hard-earned money and how our plan accommodates the income needs you and your family will need.
