                Highresin continuously seeks new ways to enrich our client experience. In addition to helping you
                achieve your long-term financial goals via portfolio management, we created a series of programs aimed
                at providing you with timely updates and education regarding the financial markets and your portfolio.

                These events, held in more than 5 cities nationwide, are designed exclusively for clients of Highresin
                and offer unprecedented access to senior decision-makers and other clients of the firm. They include
                Highresin Forecast Seminars, Investment Roundtables, Highresin Friends events, and more. There is no
                additional cost to our clients for these events, and we encourage you to attend as many as you would
                like each year.

                This high level of client support and proactive customer service is a cornerstone of our Private Client
                Group. It’s a level of service institutional investors take for granted and is usually not available to
                individuals. We believe in providing the highest level of customer service to all of our clients—whether
                they’re individual investors or institutions.

                        provide a portfolio recommendation tailored to your needs. You’ll learn exactly how we plan to
                        manage your hard-earned money and how our plan accommodates the income needs you and your family
                        will need. Only when you’re comfortable with your personalized strategy will we move forward
                        with
                        setting up your Highresin-managed portfolio.

                    <p>
                        Once you’ve decided Highresin is the right choice for your retirement, we’ll use a hands-on
                        approach
                        to setting up your account. We will manage the operations, reduce the amount of paperwork you
                        need
                        to fill out wherever possible and keep in open and frequent communication with you. Early on,
                        the
                        supervisor you’ve been working with will connect you with your Investment Counselor, who will
                        become
                        your dedicated point of contact during your years as a client.

                        <br>
                        In your first conversation with your Investment Counselor, he or she will get to know you
                        personally
                        to understand your life—your retirement goals, aspirations, living expenses, savings and any
                        other
                        financial obligations as well as personal factors such as your health and hobbies. With a
                        thorough
                        understanding of your personal situation, we can begin tailoring an investing strategy just for
                        you.

                        your Highresin portfolio is still on track to provide you with what you need. You can always
                        reach
                        out to your Investment Counselor at any time with any questions or concerns about your

                <p class="fs-5">
                    We begin by getting a deep understanding of your personal situation, goals and needs. We then
                    determine
                    the appropriate investment mix for you. Highresins’ top-down process starts with how much to invest
                    in
                    stocks, bonds, cash or other securities—to maximize the likelihood of reaching your goals.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We believe this decision has the biggest impact on your returns over time. From there, we emphasize
                    parts of the market we believe will perform best, such as different countries and sectors. Finally,
                    we
                    analyze individual stocks and other securities and select those we believe will perform best. We
                    believe
                    this active, global approach to portfolio management helps best capitalize on investment
                    opportunities
                    around the world.

                    Importantly, our approach isn’t “set it and forget it.” As a client, you’ll hear from us regularly

                    make sure your portfolio continues to serve your goals. We believe staying on the path to your goals
                    is
                    one of the biggest challenges facing investors today, which is why client service is a top focus.

                    As a client, you’ll have a dedicated Investment Counselor who provides you regularly, ongoing
