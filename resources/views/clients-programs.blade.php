                Highresin continuously seeks new ways to enrich our client experience. In addition to helping you
                achieve your long-term financial goals via portfolio management, we created a series of programs aimed
                at providing you with timely updates and education regarding the financial markets and your portfolio.

                These events, held in more than 5 cities nationwide, are designed exclusively for clients of Highresin
                and offer unprecedented access to senior decision-makers and other clients of the firm. They include
                Highresin Forecast Seminars, Investment Roundtables, Highresin Friends events, and more. There is no
                additional cost to our clients for these events, and we encourage you to attend as many as you would
                like each year.

                This high level of client support and proactive customer service is a cornerstone of our Private Client
                Group. It’s a level of service institutional investors take for granted and is usually not available to
                individuals. We believe in providing the highest level of customer service to all of our clients—whether
                they’re individual investors or institutions.

                    We begin by getting a deep understanding of your personal situation, goals and needs. We then
                    determine
                    the appropriate investment mix for you. Highresins’ top-down process starts with how much to invest
                    in
                    stocks, bonds, cash or other securities—to maximize the likelihood of reaching your goals.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We believe this decision has the biggest impact on your returns over time. From there, we emphasize
                    parts of the market we believe will perform best, such as different countries and sectors. Finally,
                    we
                    analyze individual stocks and other securities and select those we believe will perform best. We
                    believe
                    this active, global approach to portfolio management helps best capitalize on investment
                    opportunities
