            <h4>What services do we provide?</h4>

            <p>
                We provide a tailored approach to investment management and financial planning that always puts clients
                first. This starts with a comprehensive assessment of your personal situation that informs your
                investment strategy and even considers important factors outside of your portfolio. If you own an
                annuity, Highresin can analyze it and help you determine if it makes sense as a long-term investment for
                you. The result is a highly personalized approach consistent with your goals and needs.

                    We don’t sell cookie-cutter portfolios. We take the time to understand your individual goals and
                    needs and build a tailored portfolio to help you meet your objectives. And we regularly check in on
                    anything that may have changed.

                    Unlike many firms that use complex financial plans to sell you pre-packaged, commission-based

                    recommendation for you.

                <p>
                    We often see clients who were sold an annuity that does not meet their greater financial goals.
                    Often there’s a better way. We will review your annuity contract in detail to help you determine
                    whether or not it’s right for you.

                <h6>Tailored Portfolio</h6>
                <p>Much like a tailor who alters the hem, sleeves, and collar of a suit to fit an individual's
                    proportions, we take a variety of factors into account to create a portfolio tailored to your needs.
                    Some of the factors we may consider when choosing the optimal long-term investment strategy and
                    near-term portfolio tactics include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>TimeHorizon – How long do you expect or need your money to be working toward your objectives?
                    </li>
                    <li>Investment Goals – What portfolio value and cash flows do you wish to target over your time
                        horizon?</li>
                    <li>Income Needs – How can we best manage your portfolio to accommodate your cash flow needs?</li>
                    <li>Tax Considerations – How can we manage your portfolio to minimize the impact of capital gains?
                    </li>
                    <li>Outside Assets – Are there assets we don't manage for you but should consider when constructing
                        your portfolio?</li>
                    <li>Outside Income – Do you receive cash flow from sources other than your portfolio?</li>
                    <li>Restrictions or Customizations – What other personal needs or desires should we consider?</li>
                </ul>

                    Our dedicated Portfolio Evaluation Group, under the guidance of our Investment Policy Committee,
                    will use this information to provide you with written personalized portfolio analysis and investment
                    strategy recommendation. As your circumstances change, your portfolio needs may too. Your personal
