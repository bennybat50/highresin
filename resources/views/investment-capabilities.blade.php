                Expertise across all asset classes and the globe. As global investment manager, we actively listen,
                anticipate, and develop strategies that respond to the needs of our clients. Each strategy is supported
                by our strategic investing approach—an approach driven by independent thinking and guided by the rigor
                of our global research. Our investment professionals work together across regions, sectors, and asset
                classes, as they strive to select the right investment opportunities for our clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                With a broad range of equity, fixed income, and asset allocation capabilities, we provide an array of
                commingled funds, sub-advisory services, separate account management, and related services for advisors,
                institutions, financial intermediaries, and retirement plan sponsors. This diversity of product and
                distribution is a source of strength and stability; it reduces our reliance on any one strategy or
                segment and the potential impact of negative market cycles. As a result, we are able to continuously
                invest in new capabilities—for the benefit of our clients.

                    This fee structure aligns our interests with yours. In other words, if you do better, we do better.
                    Our investment approach isn’t swayed by incentives to sell you specific products because, unlike
                    many brokers, we don’t earn commissions on trades. That means we have no incentive to “churn” your
                    account with lots of buys and sells.
