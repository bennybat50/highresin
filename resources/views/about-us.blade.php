                            <p class="text-white">Highresin story is about new ideas, innovative thinking and growth through collaboration.
                                From our humble beginnings in 2015 our founders set out to create better asset management firm “with a reputation for the highest character and the soundest investment philosophy.”
                                While managing discretionary assets with a fundamental belief in capitalism and free capital markets. We start with the simple notion that supply and demand are the sole determinants of securities pricing. In addition, we believe capital markets are relatively efficient discounters of all widely known information.
                                <br><br> Thus, to add value through active management, one must identify information not widely known or interpret widely known information differently—and correctly—from other market participants. Throughout Highresin history, we have continuously developed ways to look at the market differently.

                                In addition, we have dedicated significant resources to the emerging field of behavioral finance to better understand not just the tools of finance, but also how investors use these tools. Our research has led us to develop practical applications of behavioral finance in our portfolio management process.
