    <h1>Palm Alliance Management's Net Zero Commitment</h1>
    <p>We support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions by 2050.</p>
    <p>Over the past 8 years, Palm Alliance Management has been actively involved in building one of the largest private renewable power businesses in the world. With installed renewable generating capacity of 20 GW, we now produce more than enough green energy to power Arizona and will more than double that amount once our development portfolio is brought online.</p>
    <p>We recognize that further renewable power capacity must be rapidly scaled to replace fossil fuel generation and meet expanding global electricity demand so that the world can eliminate the over 70% of global emissions that come from final energy consumption as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>Palm Alliance Management intends to build on this leading position in renewable power and do much more to contribute to the transition to net zero:</p>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>We will go further</h4>
            <p>In addition to continuing to make major investments in renewable energy globally, we will manage our investments to be consistent with the transition to a net zero economy. As a recent signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, we have made a commitment to investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 and implementation of science based approaches and standardized methodologies through which to deliver these commitments.</p>

                <li>We will publish decarbonization plans every five years consistent with the Paris Agreement.</li>
                <li>We continue to align our business with the TCFD recommendations and are targeting to incorporate TCFD disclosures for the 2022 fiscal year.</li>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Our PRI commitments include incorporating ESG factors into our investment decisions, starting with the due diligence of potential investments through to the exit process. We tailor ESG due diligence to each investment, and we create post-investment remediation plans for material ESG considerations. For all potential investments, we use internal experts and a variety of ESG frameworks to identify material ESG factors and utilize external consultants where appropriate. This analysis includes everything from ensuring environmental, legal and regulatory compliance to the identification of opportunities to add value or mitigate risk in our portfolio. Our investment teams use an ESG due diligence guideline to ensure consideration of material ESG risks and opportunities. These teams then provide a detailed memorandum to the Investment Committee outlining the merits of the transaction and disclosures relating to risks, including material ESG issues, and potential mitigation strategies. All investments made by Palm Alliance Management must be approved by the Investment Committee and must incorporate ESG matters into their evaluation, including anti-bribery and corruption, health and safety, and other ESG considerations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Upon company acquisition, we create a tailored integration plan to ensure that all material matters, including ESG risks and opportunities are prioritized. ESG risks and opportunities are actively managed by the portfolio companies with guidance from our in-house investment teams, primarily through representation on company boards and equivalent oversight bodies where all financial, operational, and strategic elements of the business are reported, considered, and where appropriate, approved. This allows us to draw on local expertise, which provides valuable insight given the wide range of asset types and locations in which we invest. Certain key performance indicators, such as serious safety incidents, are reported regularly to the applicable board or other oversight body.</p>

            <p>We are always working to maintain sound governance practices to ensure ongoing investor confidence. This involves a continual review of how evolving legislation, guidelines and best practices should be reflected in our approach. For example, we have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, including facilitation payments, and all Palm Alliance Management employees are mandated to complete an in-depth anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) training seminar annually. Palm Alliance Management maintains an ethics hotline to report suspected unethical, illegal or unsafe behavior. The reporting website can be accessed through this link. Our reporting hotline is managed by an independent third party and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We also require all portfolio companies in which we have a controlling interest to adopt an ABC policy that is equally stringent to Palm Alliance Management’s, which entails that portfolio companies install an ethics hotline within six months of acquisition.</p>

We have established a safety steering committee, which includes the CEOs and COOs of each business group, to promote common values and a strong health and safety culture, share best practices and monitor serious safety incidents.
