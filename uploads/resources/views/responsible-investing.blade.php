                <p>ESG analysis is not just about identifying and measuring risk, it is also about identifying
                    investment opportunities. We consider ESG factors alongside traditional financial
                    measurements to provide a comprehensive view of an investment and help identify those
                    investments that have the potential to deliver sustainable returns</p><br>
                <p>Our landmark acquisition of Palm Hive will unlock new opportunities for our clients, driven by greater scale, diversity and balance. Our Specialist Investment Managers embrace ESG incorporation as it best fits their investment process and enables us to offer a full complement of Responsible Investing strategies to our clients.</p><br>
