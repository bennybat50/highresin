            <h4 class="title">Volunteering and donations</h4>
            <p>We encourage our staff to play an active role in the communities they work in, for instance by
                supporting participation in local volunteering activities.</p>
            <h4 class="title">International charities</h4>
            <p>We also invest in good causes that are aligned with our own culture and values and those that
                help children and students maximise their talents. Each year the Group allocates a global budget
                to match staff donations to international charities for specific causes. In the past years we
                have collected and donated funds for the fight against Ebola, the appeal for Typhoon Haiyan in
                the Philippines, the tsunami in Japan, the Sichuan earthquake in China and for research on
                neuroendocrine tumours.</p>
            <h4 class="title">Local fundraising</h4>
            <p>We make donations to various local charities such as the Alzheimer’s Society and Brainwave
                initiative in the UK and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in
                different locations.</p><br>
            <p>Examples of our local community affairs and charity engagement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the <b>UK,</b> we promote tax-efficient payroll donating to staff through a Give as You Earn scheme. In addition we organise a series of volunteer days each year, where teams of volunteers engage in activities such as refurbishing school gardens, encouraging children to get involved in sports and transforming the gardens of housing projects. And since 2010, Palm Alliance Management has hosted an annual coffee mornings, raising almost £30,000 to date.</li>
                <li>In <b> Dublin,</b> an annual awareness week is organised to raise money for a charity nominated by employees. In 2016, Dublin employees nominated the Palm Alliance Foundation which raises funds for the Children's University Hospital. Since 2010, Palm Alliance Fund Management and staff have donated over €29,000 to the various charities nominated by staff.</li>
                <li>In <b>New York,</b> since 2010 our employees have been participating in HELP USA's annual toy drive. HELP USA is a national not-for-profit organisation with a mission to empower the homeless and others in need to become and remain self-reliant. Palm Alliance Management New York also participates in Operation Backpack. This is an annual drive to provide children with brand new backpacks, filled with classroom supplies, for the first day of the new school year. The Operation Backpack team aims to ensure no child living in a New York City shelter will be left out when the new term begins in September.</li>
                <li>In <b>Hong Kong</b> staff participate annually in ‘The Dress Special Day’ organised by The
                    Community Chest as well as the 'Dress Pink Day' organised by the Hong Kong Cancer Fund.</li>
                <li>In <b>Switzerland </b> In Switzerland our employees participate in an annual charity run. Participants ‘earn’ money for each lap they run which is then donated to various charities.

    <h1>PROMOTING FINANCIAL EDUCATION</h1>
    <p>Palm Alliance Management Investment Academy is an initiative that seeks to share knowledge with our clients and the wider community to help enhance their understanding of the investment world. It is set across three pillars.
        <br><br>

        First, we share our expertise with our clients through the publication of educational insights, aiming to help our audience making better decisions instead of promoting any of our funds.
        <br><br>

        Through local partnerships, we support our distributors by providing them with specific knowledge. In the U.S, PAM has reached six years in partnership with psychologists and internationally renowned authors in the field of cognitive psychology, who produces the weekly behavioural finance lessons published on our website. In Spain, Palm Alliance Management is working with the Spanish Stock Exchange. In the UK: Access to some of the brightest minds in the world of science and engineering. Unparalleled environment to leverage state-of-the-art technology.  <br><br>

        We proudly sponsor initiatives that support the financial education of the youngest. In the most recent one, we sponsored the publication of a children’ book communicating basic finance and economics education (Basic economic principles: savings and investment). We are also the proud sponsors of the book “Business, Funding and Entrepreunership”.</p>
