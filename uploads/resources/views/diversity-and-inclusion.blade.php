                            This distinctive approach is part of our commitment to embrace all aspects of diversity, equity and inclusion. It helps us unlock the power that comes from building teams that encourage active voices at every level.<br><br>

                        <p>To help mitigate any potential unconscious bias from the early-career hiring process, our Talent Acquisition Team stopped sharing résumés with hiring managers, so they could focus on the candidate — their background, experience and thought process.</p>
                        <p>As a result of our DE&I efforts, we hired a more racially and gender diverse pool of interns, with 50/50 gender balance and 58% representation from racial minorities.</p><br>

                        <p>And we're proud to say that a fair pay study conducted by an independent consultant demonstrated that we have pay equity broadly in the U.S.</p><br>
